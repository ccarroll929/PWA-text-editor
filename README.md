## Description

In this project, I created a text editor application that meets Progressive Web Apps (PWA) criteria. This single page application can run in the browser and it can also be installed locally to run offline. 

### Technologies Used
- IndexedDB as a database
- Webpack to bundle front-end code
- Workbox to create a service worker that caches static assets
- And Render to deploy the application 

### User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT to create code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use.
```

### Screenshot of Application

This application is deployed on `Render`. To access it, click [here](https://pwa-text-editor-lan8.onrender.com/).

## Installation
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Use command "node -v" in the terminal to see if it is already installed on your computer

## Usage
To use the application from the command line (after installing dependencies):
- Use command `npm install` to install dependencies
- Use command `npm run build` to build front-end code
- Use command `npm start` to start the server on your localhost
